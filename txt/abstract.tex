Due to the inherent complexity of computers and computer programs, bog-standard
computer users are destitute for knowledge. Learning how to program computer
software is an enjoyable and engaging way to teach users a concrete skill, and
at the same time provide the necessary foundations for further self-education
towards computer erudition. However, the current tools that are used in
teaching have several problems, including bad error messages and being
difficult to install for non-technical users. We repent the present situation,
and present the idea of an implementation of the Haskell programming language
with unlockable features as a solution. We also offer musings on an interactive
online IDE idea to get users quickly up and running with our language.

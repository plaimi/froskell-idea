Due to the inherent complexity of computers and computer programs, 
bog-standard computer users are destitute for knowledge. Learning how to 
program computer software is an enjoyable and engaging way to teach users a 
concrete skill, and at the same time provide the necessary foundations for 
further self-education towards computer erudition. We repent the present 
situation, and present the idea of an implementation of the Haskell programing 
language with unlockable features as a solution. We also offer musings on an 
interactive online IDE idea to get users quickly up and running with our 
language.

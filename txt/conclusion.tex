People are beginning to realise that programming is a fundamental skill in our
increasingly computerised society.  Not just for software engineers and
computer scientists, but for everyone. However, the present languages and tools
used to teach programming have several problems. They often have bad error
messages filled with concepts that are beyond beginners, and they suffer from
having to write ``magic incantations''.  The tools sometimes have little or bad
support on some platforms, creating a barrier to entry for inexperienced
students.

We propose to solve these issues by creating a programming language, based on
Haskell, for teaching with unlockable levels of features, solving the first two
problems. To make the barrier to entry as low as possible we propose the
creation of an online IDE to let users write and run code in the browser.  This
IDE also opens up many other exciting possibilities, such as collaboration,
sharing, virtual classrooms with integrated exercises, and game programming.
